examples sourced from:

    https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/tree/master/examples

note the examples are taken *exactly* as they were online, except for:

    responses.md - swagger does not support multiple different reponse types
                   per response code (either based on consumes or produces).
                   this example has been slightly modified to match what can
                   be acheived with swagger

    requests.md  - as per response.md

    parameter.md - as per response.md
